    "# Final Report  â€“  Finding the best Place in Toronto for a new grocery store\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "In this project I want to explore the possible neighborhoods for a grocery store in the city of Toronto. Entrepreneurs of small businesses like grocery stores will have to pay attention to competition. For example, it is common to see several grocery stores in a community. Business owners should review their competitors to provide better buying conditions when they want to win customers.<br />\n",
    "The location should be sufficient to meet the needs of a grocery store designed by an entrepreneur. \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postal Codes \n",
    "\n",
    "Will use the list of postal codes of Toronto that we used in week 3. Postal codes beginning with M are located within the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario. Only the first three characters are listed, corresponding to the Forward Sortation Area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link of the data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Foursquare API Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We  need to find out the location of all the grocery stores in the city of toronto. In order to get the required information, we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a local search services company that offers its service on the mobile platform as well as a website. The Foursquare API allows application developers to interact with the Foursquare platformLog in to Foursquare as a developer in order to get the idea of the API request and response patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](Image/Foursquare.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final data frame which will be used in this study contains columns with following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neighborhood\n",
    "2. Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "3. Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "4. Venue\n",
    "5. Venue Latitude\n",
    "6. Venue Longitude\n",
    "7. Venue Category\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Methodology\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "In this project I want to anlayze the possible locations for a grocery store using clustering algorithms such as k-means. The features that i am going to use are longitude and latitude of previous stores in different locations.<br />\n",
    "In order to find the appropriate number of clusters I will use Silhouette score. Silhouette can be used to validate the consistency between resulting clusters of data. Silhouette score works using the average distance between points within cluster and the other cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](Image/SC.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "XML\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Silhouette score for diferent values of K is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](Image/K_analysis.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters of the grocery stores based on their location\n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](Image/clusters.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Table below shows clusters assigned to each brough\n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](Image/clustertable.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in the city of Toronto to start a new grocery store. We examined the different boroughs based on the location of the grocery stores which already exist. We found that there are two clusters of grocery stores in the city of Toronto. One cluster is around the North York and the other one is around Downtown Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I used Silhouette score to find the optimum number of clusters which was two based on the data that I analyzed. As I mentioned before I found two important boroughs in the city of Toronto according. Based on the number of grocery stores in each borough, I conclude that North York is a better option to open up a new grocery store, since there are large number of stores in downton Toronto.  "
